"""
GPQA with Hints: Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness Evaluation

Based on the methodology from "Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think" (Anthropic, 2025)
and the original GPQA implementation.

This evaluation tests CoT faithfulness by:
1. Presenting questions with and without hints
2. Measuring whether models acknowledge hints in their reasoning
3. Comparing performance with and without hints

# Run basic evaluation
inspect eval evaluation/gpqa/gpqa_with_hints.py

# Run with CoT enabled
inspect eval evaluation/gpqa/gpqa_with_hints.py -T enable_cot=true

# Run with specific hint types
inspect eval evaluation/gpqa/gpqa_with_hints.py -T hint_types=metadata,answer

# Run with limited samples for testing
inspect eval evaluation/gpqa/gpqa_with_hints.py --limit 10
